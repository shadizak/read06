## What is a computer?

A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end.

All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

The main 4 parts of a computer "CPU, Input, Memory, Output"

## Binary system

Computer understand only 0,1 and this is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and its called a bitWith more bit you can represent more complex Information:1.  learned how to convert between binary system and decimal system2.  How to represented data in the computer.3. Then talk about logic and  Logic gates ex. and - or - xor...4. Then talk about cpu and memory .5. The end talk about hardware and softwareWhat's the difference between hardware and software?The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute—and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't really think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called software. They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful—and that's why millions of us can no longer live without them!
